*Tool: a device or implement used to carry out a particular function.*

I’ve been on the job grind for over a year now, and one thing has become painfully obvious: employers are convinced that AI tools can replace entry-level engineers. I keep hearing it in interviews, seeing it online, and watching friends struggle to break into the industry. Some of the sharpest people I know can’t even get past the ATS filter because they don’t have “one year of professional experience” for a job that’s supposed to be *entry-level*.  

It feels like the bar keeps moving higher. Companies want us to show up as fully trained engineers, even as they argue that AI copilots, frameworks, and automation make the work “easy.” But from where I’m sitting, that couldn’t be further from the truth. The hardest parts of software engineering haven’t gone away — and tools don’t magically make them disappear.  

That’s really the point I want to make here: **tools don’t make software engineering easy.**

## In the context of programming

At the code level, AI copilots can autocomplete entire functions, but they don’t fix the fundamental problems. You still need to know *why* something works, what edge cases to test, and how your design will hold up over time.  

I’ve personally spent nights stuck on bugs that no AI tool could explain. Sure, the IDE highlighted an error, but it didn’t tell me that the deeper issue was my misunderstanding of the problem iteself. Tools accelerate the boring parts, but they can’t substitute the actual thinking that programming demands.  

## In the context of engineering

Zooming out to the engineering level, tools like CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and cloud platforms promise to make things seamless. But anyone who’s worked on a real project knows that tools don’t solve the problem of *requirements changing every week*. They don’t make legacy systems disappear.  

I think about the massive projects that make headlines for failing — like healthcare.gov’s launch or Hawaii’s rail project back home. These teams weren’t missing tools; they had every cutting-edge resource available. What they couldn’t escape was the sheer complexity of humans, politics, budgets, and moving targets. Tools can help smooth out the workflow, but they don’t shield you from the difficulty of the work itself.  

## In the context of relationships

And in the end, all of this boils down to people. We use tools like Slack, Jira, and Notion to stay organized, but relationships — whether in a workplace or in life — take more than a kanban board. Communication still breaks down. Trust still has to be earned. Tools can amplify teamwork, but they don’t replace the work of actually being a good teammate.  

The same way I’ve seen classmates complain about “bad group projects,” I’ve seen companies with every collaboration tool under the sun still fail because people weren’t on the same page. Tools don’t fix human nature.  

## Okay!

So why does it feel like being an engineer — or even just becoming one — is harder than ever? Because it *is* hard, and it’s supposed to be. Software engineering is about solving problems people care about, and that’s never been easy.  

The final answer is this: **tools can help us go faster, but they don’t lower the mountain.** Employers may think AI can do the work of junior engineers, but the truth is that the hardest, most important parts of software engineering — design, reasoning, collaboration — are still squarely on human shoulders.  

And that’s why, when I look at the grind of getting into the industry, the real question I keep asking myself isn’t “why isn’t this easier with all the tools out there?” but rather: “is this worth the difficulty?”

For me, the answer is yes. The opportunity to do real good and touch people’s lives will always be worth the challenge. I honestly believe software engineers have the capacity to be a driving force for good in this world — and that’s what makes the struggle worth it.
